METHOD ONE
    - Create 4 points at respective [x,y]s
    - Generate count of "seen" devices/data points
    - Use Shepard's Method to generate gradient  


METHOD TWO
    - Map coordinate locations of all devices
    - Discretize floorplan into chunks of given size (by room?)
    - Count num devices in each chunk
    - Place "count" node in center of bin OR (OPTIONAL) find center of mass
    - Use Shepard's Method to generate gradient

- Put map under tab, auto-display most recent data
